# Interaction statement

## Scene 1
In this scene, the user will see a big poster, on the right side, Billy (a character from the dead silence film) wears an evil smile and puts his forefinger in
front of his mouth to imply keeping silent. The left side of the picture writes "Dead Silence" to indicate the theme of the project. <br>
Also the billy eyes will bleed.  And some whispers sound will begin to suggest to remember to keep silent.  <br>
When the user clicks "begin", the user will get into the next scene.

## Scene 2
The main character comes home and finds no one at home. Some eyes hide in the dark and when the mouse moves to the right part, the eyes will blink. This will make a feeling of horror. Because in the history, 
human have a fear of eyes. <br>
If the user move their mouse to the painting hanging on the wall. A poem about mary shaw will pop up. <br>
" Beware the stare of Mary Shaw. She had no children, only puppets and if you see her in your dreams Make sure you never ever scream…"
This poem is a key of the story.

 <br>
The dialog box will say "One day, you come back home. You find room is so silent and dark. You walk to the room and want to have a sleep ". It indicates that 
the user should click the door to go to the next scene.

## Scene 3
In this scene, user will see the bedroom. The dialog will say "Looks something on the bed". This indicates that user should click the bed. <br>
Then, a sound of flipping bed sheet will come and a puppet called billy pops up.<br>
The billy will say "Hey, I am Billy. I am one of puppets Mary Shaw have. If you want to survive, you have to destory me."<br>
This one perfectly match with the poem. "She had no children, only puppets" In the "dead silence" film, if the main character wants to destroy mary shaw, he has to 
destroy every puppet mary shaw has. <br>
The user should click on the "begin" button to continue<br>

## Scene 4
The scene is about the game against billy puppets. User has fire as a weapon. 
In the movie called "dead silence". The man character uses fire to destroy those puppets.  <br>
The game totally has 20 puppets and the user has to destroy them all in limited time to win this game. Otherwise user will be defeated by mary shaw. <br>
On the top of the scene. user can see the time elapsing and also user's blood loss and on the right top of the scene, it will show the number of billy you have killed.<br>
The background music is clock ticking to indicate the time elapsing. <br>

## Scene 5
This scene is based on whether you win the game in scene4. If the user wins the game, scene 5 will pop up.
In the scene, mary shaw lies on the ground with a female scream. It indicates that mary shaw is defeated and the scream is from mary shaw.

## Scene 6
This scene will pop up when the user loses the game. It is a gif i made and the set of pictures is from the internet. <br>
Mary shaw appears from the curtain.  This matches the eyes hiding behind the curtain in scene 2. Those are actually mary shaw's eyes.
Then when mary shaw approaches, a male scream comes and that indicates that the user is killed and the tongue is taken by mary shaw. <br>
This matches with the poem again. "if you see her in your dreams. Make sure you never ever scream…" But the man screams means that he is killed. It is the same as the 
movie. The ending is the main character screams and his tongue is taken by mary shaw.
